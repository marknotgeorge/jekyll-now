<p>I'm Mark Johnson, a hobbyist developer from Derby in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>My goal for 2018 is to find myself a bona-fide developer job.</p>
<p>I've been interested in IT since getting a Commodore 64 way back in the 80's. I studied Computer Science at the University of Bradford, graduating in 1994</p>
<p>Although I've worked outside IT since graduation, I've maintained a keen interest in coding, mainly in C++ and C#.</p>
